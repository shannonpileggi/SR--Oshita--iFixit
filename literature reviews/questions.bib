Various strategies have been recommended when building a regression model: a) use the right statistical method that matches the structure of the data; b) ensure an appropriate sample size by limiting the number of variables according to the number of events; c) prevent or correct for model overfitting; d) be aware of the problems associated with automatic variable selection procedures (such as stepwise), and e) always assess the performance of the final model in regard to calibration and discrimination measures. If resources allow, validate the prediction model on external data.},

Tire life data are obtained from a laboratory test, which is developed to duplicate field failures. A number of parameters related to tire geometry and physical properties are selected as explanatory variables that potentially affect a tire???s life on test. Analysis of the life test data is performed via the Cox survival regression model. The paper also elaborates on the application of an ordinary (non-survival) linear regression to modeling the failure initiation and propagation. The developed statistical models help to identify the elements of tire design affecting the probability of tire failure due to the failure mode in question. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Objective To assess the effect of HCV infection on clinical and immunologic pro- gression of HIV disease and immunologic response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Design Prospective cohort study. Setting University-based, urban HIV clinic in the United States. Patients There were 1955 patients enrolled between January 1995 and January 2001 whowere eligible for analysis because of having at least 1 return visit to the clinic and being free of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at enrollment. Median (in- terquartile range) length of follow-up was 2.19 (1.00-3.50) years for HCV-infected and 2.00 (1.00-3.00) years for HCV-uninfected patients. Main Outcome Measures Progression to an AIDS-defining illness, survival, and progression to a CD4 cell count below 200/µL; CD4 cell count change following ini- tiation of effective HAART (resulting in a viral load of ?400 copies/mL recorded at ?75{\%} of measurements). Results No difference was detected in the risk of acquiring an AIDS-defining illness (HCV-infected patients, 231 events [26.4{\%}] and HCV-uninfected patients, 264 events [24.4{\%}]; relative hazard [RH], 1.03; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.23) or in the risk of death (HCV-infected patients, 153 deaths [17.5{\%}] and HCV- uninfected patients, 168 deaths [15.5{\%}]; RH, 1.05; 95{\%} CI, 0.85 -1.30). Although an increased risk of death was detected in the subgroup of 429 HCV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 cell count of 50/µL through 200/µL (RH, 1.51; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-2.27), after adjustment for exposure to HAART and its effectiveness in a multi- variate Cox regression analysis, death was not independently associated with HCV infection in this subgroup (RH, 1.01; 95{\%} CI, 0.65-1.56). Similarly, in those receiving effective HAART (n=208), there was no difference in the increase in CD4 cell count or CD4 percentage during HAART in HCV-infected compared with HCV-uninfected patients.Conclusions Among patients in this urban US cohort, we did not detect evidence that HCV infection substantially alters the risk of dying, developing AIDS, or respond- ing immunologically to HAART, especially after accounting for differences in its ad- ministration and effectiveness.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Gene expression analysis has identified several breast cancer subtypes, including basal-like, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive/estrogen receptor negative (HER2+/ER-), luminal A, and luminal B. OBJECTIVES: To determine population-based distributions and clinical associations for breast cancer subtypes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Immunohistochemical surrogates for each subtype were applied to 496 incident cases of invasive breast cancer from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (ascertained between May 1993 and December 1996), a population-based, case-control study that oversampled premenopausal and African American women. Subtype definitions were as follows: luminal A (ER+ and/or progesterone receptor positive [PR+], HER2-), luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2+), basal-like (ER-, PR-, HER2-, cytokeratin 5/6 positive, and/or HER1+), HER2+/ER- (ER-, PR-, and HER2+), and unclassified (negative for all 5 markers). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined the prevalence of breast cancer subtypes within racial and menopausal subsets and determined their associations with tumor size, axillary nodal status, mitotic index, nuclear pleomorphism, combined grade, p53 mutation status, and breast cancer-specific survival. RESULTS: The basal-like breast cancer subtype was more prevalent among premenopausal African American women (39{\%}) compared with postmenopausal African American women (14{\%}) and non-African American women (16{\%}) of any age (P{\textless}.001), whereas the luminal A subtype was less prevalent (36{\%} vs 59{\%} and 54{\%}, respectively). The HER2+/ER- subtype did not vary with race or menopausal status (6{\%}-9{\%}). Compared with luminal A, basal-like tumors had more TP53 mutations (44{\%} vs 15{\%}, P{\textless}.001), higher mitotic index (odds ratio [OR], 11.0; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 5.6-21.7), more marked nuclear pleomorphism (OR, 9.7; 95{\%} CI, 5.3-18.0), and higher combined grade (OR, 8.3; 95{\%} CI, 4.4-15.6). Breast cancer-specific survival differed by subtype (P{\textless}.001), with shortest survival among HER2+/ER- and basal-like subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Basal-like breast tumors occurred at a higher prevalence among premenopausal African American patients compared with postmenopausal African American and non-African American patients in this population-based study. A higher prevalence of basal-like breast tumors and a lower prevalence of luminal A tumors could contribute to the poor prognosis of young African American women with breast cancer.},

abstract = {Children who enter the child welfare system at a young age are at risk for a myriad of developmental, physical, and mental health problems. The risks faced by these vulnerable young children may be exacerbated by placement disruptions during foster care. This study utilizes administrative data from Illinois to explore the potential of child care assistance programs to reduce placement disruptions among foster children under the age of five. Survival analysis results suggest that receipt of child care assistance is associated with a reduced risk of placement disruption over time, especially for children who enter foster care as preschoolers. These findings are discussed in the context of the literature on the compensatory role that early care and education can play in short circuiting the detrimental impacts of toxic stress. With regard to public policy, they suggest an important, largely unexamined, role for child care support within the child welfare system. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Introduction: This clinical study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of innovative fiber-reinforced-thermoplastic (FRP) bonded orthodontic retainers. Methods: Anterior lingual retainers were formed by using a 2-step process from preimpregnated unidirectional long glass fibers (volume fraction, 0.25) in a thermoplastic resin matrix of either poly(ethylene terephthalate glycol) or polycarbonate. Seventy-six canine-to-canine retainers were placed in 56 patients by using the acid-etch technique over a 34-month period. They were evaluated for clinical acceptability to function as a retainer, structural integrity of the FRP, and integrity of the bonding. Variables examined included material composition, design factors, and mechanism of failure of the retainers. The results were analyzed by using the univariate Kaplan-Meier survival method and the multivariate Cox regression model. Results: The overall median survival time was 7.6 months, with 33{\%} surviving after 12 months. The retainer with the longest service was in use for over 24 months. The variables with the most significant effects and improved survival rates were FRP formulation (polycarbonate), retainer thickness (1.02 mm), and number of teeth overlapped (all 6 teeth). Failure was primarily due to bond failure at the enamel-adhesive or adhesive-FRP interface. Conclusions: With improved survival times, FRP retainers could be a viable alternative to metal retainers. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Association of Orthodontists.},

abstract = {Background: Cancer survival studies are commonly analyzed using survival-time prediction models for cancer prognosis. A number of different performance metrics are used to ascertain the concordance between the predicted risk score of each patient and the actual survival time, but these metrics can sometimes conflict. Alternatively, patients are sometimes divided into two classes according to a survival-time threshold, and binary classifiers are applied to predict each patient's class. Although this approach has several drawbacks, it does provide natural performance metrics such as positive and negative predictive values to enable unambiguous assessments. Methods: We compare the survival-time prediction and survival-time threshold approaches to analyzing cancer survival studies. We review and compare common performance metrics for the two approaches. We present new randomization tests and cross-validation methods to enable unambiguous statistical inferences for several performance metrics used with the survival-time prediction approach. We consider five survival prediction models consisting of one clinical model, two gene expression models, and two models from combinations of clinical and gene expression models. Results: A public breast cancer dataset was used to compare several performance metrics using five prediction models. 1) For some prediction models, the hazard ratio from fitting a Cox proportional hazards model was significant, but the two-group comparison was insignificant, and vice versa. 2) The randomization test and cross-validation were generally consistent with the p-values obtained from the standard performance metrics. 3) Binary classifiers highly depended on how the risk groups were defined; a slight change of the survival threshold for assignment of classes led to very different prediction results. Conclusions: 1) Different performance metrics for evaluation of a survival prediction model may give different conclusions in its discriminatory ability. 2) Evaluation using a high-risk versus low-risk group comparison depends on the selected risk-score threshold; a plot of p-values from all possible thresholds can show the sensitivity of the threshold selection. 3) A randomization test of the significance of Somers' rank correlation can be used for further evaluation of performance of a prediction model. 4) The cross-validated power of survival prediction models decreases as the training and test sets become less balanced.

The research questions addressed are the following: (a) How do answer quality and answer speed vary across question types? (b) How do the relationships between answer quality and answer speed vary across question types? (c) How do the best quality answers and the fastest answers differ in terms of answer quality and answer speed across question types? (d) How do trends in answer quality vary over time across ques- tion types? From the posting of 3,000 questions in six CQAs, 5,356 answers were harvested and analyzed. There was a significant difference in answer quality and answer speed across question types, and there were generally no significant relationships between answer quality and answer speed. The best quality answers had better overall answer quality than the fastest answers but generally took longer to arrive. In addition, although the trend in answer quality had been mostly random across all question types, the quality of answers appeared to improve gradually when given time. By highlighting the subtle nuances in answer quality and answer speed across question types, this study is an attempt to explore a territory of CQA research that has hitherto been relatively uncharted.

abstract = {Automatic Subjective Question Answering (ASQA), which aims at answering users' subjective questions using summaries of multiple opinions, becomes increasingly important. One challenge of ASQA is that expected answers for subjective questions may not readily exist in theWeb. The rising and popularity of Community Question Answering (CQA) sites, which provide platforms for people to post and answer questions, provides an alternative to ASQA. One important task of ASQA is question subjectivity identification, which identifies whether a user is asking a subjective question. Unfortunately, there has been little labeled training data available for this task. In this paper, we propose an approach to collect training data automatically by utilizing social signals in CQA sites without involving any manual labeling. Experimental results show that our data-driven approach achieves 9:37{\%} relative improvement over the supervised approach using manually labeled data, and achieves 5:15{\%} relative gain over a stateof- the-art semi-supervised approach. In addition, we propose several heuristic features for question subjectivity identification. By adding these features, we achieve 11:23{\%} relative improvement over word n-gram feature under the same experimental setting.},

abstract = {Technical questions and answers (Q{\&}A) services have become a valuable resource for developers. A prominent example of technical Q{\&}A website is StackOverflow (SO), which relies on a growing community of more than two millions of users who actively contribute by asking questions and providing answers. To maintain the value of this resource, poor quality questions - among the more than 6,000 asked daily - have to be filtered out. Currently, poor quality questions are manually identified and reviewed by selected users in SO, this costs considerable time and effort. Automating the process would save time and unload the review queue, improving the efficiency of SO as a resource for developers. We present an approach to automate the classification of questions according to their quality. We present an empirical study that investigates how to model and predict the quality of a question by considering as features both the contents of a post (e.g., from simple textual features to more complex readability metrics) and community-related aspects (e.g., popularity of a user in the community). Our findings show that there is indeed the possibility of at least a partial automation of the costly SO review process.},

abstract = {—Stack Overflow (SO) is a question and answers (Q{\&}A) web platform on software development that is gaining in popularity. With increasing popularity often comes a very unwelcome side effect: A decrease in the average quality of a post. To keep Q{\&}A websites like SO useful it is vital that this side effect is countered. Previous research proved to be reasonably successful in using properties of questions to help identify low quality questions to be later reviewed and improved. We present an approach to improve the classification of high and low quality questions based on a novel source of information: the analysis of the code fragments in SO questions. We show that we get similar performance to classification based on a wider set of metrics thus potentially reaching a better overall classification.},

@article{Rechavi2011,
abstract = {This study investigates two questions concerning question-and-answer sites. We analyzed data from "Yahoo!Answers", including 19 months and over 20 million interactions per month. The first question investigates the differences in response time and in the average number of answers between anasker's ranking of "Best Answer" (BA) and the community's BA. The second question concerns the impact of an explicit network on several implicit network activities. The results imply that askers use response time as a parameter to choose the BA, whereas the community chooses the BA with no regard to Answer Response Time (ART). Another finding implies that if the answerer is not listed in the asker's "explicit network, " it might result in longer ranking (award) time and in a slightly decreased number of answer stars (satisfaction-rate indicator).And yet, one result might be surprising. Being a "fan" of the asker implies a long response time to the question. This finding might contradict the intuition that our friends are the first to provide answers to our questions. Several explanations of this result from different research fields are suggested in the discussion.},

abstract = {Assessing the quality of user generated con- tent is an important problem for many web forums. While quality is currently assessed manually, we propose an algorithm to as- sess the quality of forum posts automati- cally and test it on data provided by Nab- ble.com. We use state-of-the-art classifi- cation techniques and experiment with five feature classes: Surface, Lexical, Syntactic, Forum specific and Similarity features. We achieve an accuracy of 89{\%} on the task of automatically assessing post quality in the software domain using forum specific fea- tures. Without forum specific features, we achieve an accuracy of 82{\%}.},

@article{Harper2008,
abstract = {Question and answer (Q{\&}A) sites such as Yahoo! Answers are places where users ask questions and others answer them. In this paper, we investigate predictors of answer quality through a comparative, controlled field study of responses provided across several online Q{\&}A sites. Along with several quantitative results concerning the effects of factors such as question topic and rhetorical strategy, we present two high-level messages. First, you get what you pay for in Q{\&}A sites. Answer quality was typically higher in Google Answers (a fee-based site) than in the free sites we studied, and paying more money for an answer led to better outcomes. Second, we find that a Q{\&}A site's community of users contributes to its success. Yahoo! Answers, a Q{\&}A site where anybody can answer questions, outperformed sites that depend on specific individuals to answer questions, such as library reference services.},

abstract = {Asking the right question in the right way is an art (and a science). In a community question-answering setting, a good question is not just one that is found to be useful by other people—a question is good if it is also pre-sented clearly and shows prior research. Using a com-munity question-answering site that allows voting over the questions, we show that there is a notion of question quality that goes beyond mere popularity. We present techniques using latent topical models to automatically predict the quality of questions based on their content. Our best system achieves a prediction accuracy of 72{\%}, beating out strong baselines by a significant amount. We also examine the effect of question quality on the dy-namics of user behavior and the longevity of questions.},

## Summer Research, 2017

### _Student:_ Lisa Oshita
### _Faculty advisor:_ Shannon Pileggi
### _Industry advisor:_ Anthony Pileggi

### Objective
The objective of this summer research is to utilize survival analysis techniques to model time until a question is answered from iFixit's Q&A forum.  (https://www.ifixit.com/Answers)

### Specific Aims
1.  Thoroughly explore the iFixit Answer's forum in conjunction with the data to understand what the data represents.
2.  Perform a literature review to determine if other researcher's have identified characteristics associated with either likelihood or timeliness of a question being answered.
3.  Identify potential parametric distributions suitable for the time to event data.  Compare pros and cons of parametric versus nonparametric models.
4.  Create new variables necessary to model time until a question is answered.  For example, this may involve classifications of product type or parsing text strings to identify if a question mark is present.      
5.

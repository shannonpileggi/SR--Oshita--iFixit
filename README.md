## Summer Research, 2017

### _Student:_ Lisa Oshita
### _Faculty advisor:_ Shannon Pileggi
### _Industry advisor:_ Anthony Pileggi

### Objective
The objective of this summer research is to utilize survival analysis techniques to model time until a question is answered from iFixit's Q&A forum.  (https://www.ifixit.com/Answers)

### Specific Aims
1.  Utilize GitHub to collaborate on project materials and updates.
3.  Write all R code according to Hadley Wickam's Style Guide (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).  All R code should be written in a reproducible manner, such that code will execute when applied to a new data set. 
4.  Thoroughly explore the iFixit Answer's forum in conjunction with the data to understand what the data represents.
5.  Perform a literature review to determine if other researchers have identified characteristics associated with either likelihood or timeliness of a question being answered.
6.  Identify potential parametric distributions suitable for the time to event data.  Compare pros and cons of parametric versus nonparametric models.
7.  Create new variables necessary to model time until a question is answered.  For example, this may involve classifications of product type or parsing text strings to identify if a question mark is present.      
8.  Research the incorporation and interpretation of ptential time varying covariates.  Present an argument for the best treatment of time varying covariates, if appropriate.
9.  Create a model to predict time until question is answered.  
+ Turn this model into a function that can be applied to any new data set
+ Allow users to calculate or sort through predictions for specific questions
+ Write a user manual on how to utlize the function and interpret the results
